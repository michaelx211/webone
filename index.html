  <p>I have thirst for knowledge, hard-working drop-everything attitude, and an empathic mindset and I am confident that I can offer the qualities that you seek in a member of your team. I would like the opportunity to have an interview and share more about myself and skills I could bring to your team. Please feel free to contact me to arrange an interview. I hope you consider me for this opening position. Thank you so much for your time.</p>

<p>Here he comes Here comes Speed Racer. He's a demon on wheels. The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle with Gilligan the Skipper too the millionaire and his wife? He's gainin' on you so you better look alive. He busy revin' up his Powerful Mach 5. Boy the way Glen Miller played. Songs that made the hit parade. Guys like us we had it made. Those were the days. All of them had hair of gold like their mother the youngest one in curls. And if you threw a party - invited everyone you knew. You would see the biggest gift would be from me and the card attached would say thank you for being a friend. A man is born he's a man of means. Then along come two they got nothin' but their jeans.</p>

<p>And when the odds are against him and their dangers work to do. You bet your life Speed Racer he will see it through. And when the odds are against him and their dangers work to do. You bet your life Speed Racer he will see it through. we might as well say... Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor! Makin their way the only way they know how. That's just a little bit more than the law will allow! The weather started getting rough - the tiny ship was tossed. If not for the courage of the fearless crew the Minnow would be lost. the Minnow would be lost. It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the Muppets on the Muppet Show tonight.</p>

<p>Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny the last Battlestar – Galactica - leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest - a shining planet known as Earth. But they got diff'rent strokes. It takes diff'rent strokes - it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world? Straightnin' the curves. Flatnin' the hills Someday the mountain might get ‘em but the law never will. Makin' your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Takin' a break from all your worries sure would help a lot. Fleeing from the Cylon tyranny the last Battlestar – Galactica - leads a rag-tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest - a shining planet known as Earth. Sunday Monday Happy Days. Tuesday Wednesday Happy Days. Thursday Friday Happy Days.Saturday what a day. Groovin' all week with you. The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle with Gilligan the Skipper too the millionaire and his wife. Well we're movin' on up to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the sky. But they got diff'rent strokes. It takes diff'rent strokes - it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world. Thank you for being a friend. Travelled down the road and back again. Your heart is true you're a pal and a confidant! Goodbye gray sky hello blue. There's nothing can hold me when I hold you. Feels so right it cant be wrong. Rockin' and rollin' all week long.</p>

<p>Maybe you and me were never meant to be. But baby think of me once in awhile. I'm at WKRP in Cincinnati. Sunny Days sweepin' the clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street.</p>

<p>Then one day he was shootin' at some food and up through the ground came a bubblin' crude. Oil that is. Its mission - to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before. Makin' your way in the world today takes everything you've got. Takin' a break from all your worries sure would help a lot. It's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to meet the Muppets on the Muppet Show tonight. Got kind of tired packin' and unpackin' - town to town and up and down the dial. Baby if you've ever wondered - wondered whatever became of me. I'm living on the air in Cincinnati. Cincinnati WKRP? You wanna be where you can see our troubles are all the same. You wanna be where everybody knows Your name.</p>
