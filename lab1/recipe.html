      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
          <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
          <li>3 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
          <li>1/4 cup superfine sugar</li>
          <li>2 to 3 drops gel food coloring (see below)</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla, almond or mint extract</li>
          <li>Assorted fillings (see below)</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Special equipment: Oven with convection setting, 4 baking sheets, 3 silicone baking mats, Fine-mesh sieve, Pastry bag with 1/4-inch round tip</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F using the convection setting. Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats. Measure the confectioners' sugar and almond flour by spooning them into measuring cups and leveling with a knife. Transfer to a bowl; whisk to combine.</li>

        <li>Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, a little at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible. It will take a while, and up to 2 tablespoons of coarse almond flour may be left; just toss it.</li>

        <li>Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes.</li>

        <li>Transfer the beaten egg whites to the bowl with the almond flour mixture. Draw a rubber spatula halfway through the mixture and fold until incorporated, giving the bowl a quarter turn with each fold.</li>

        <li>Add the food coloring and extract (see below). Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/4-inch circles (24 per sheet). Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles.</li>

        <li>Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat).</li>

        <li>Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a "foot," about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of filling (see below).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Almond-Raspberry:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Tint the batter with 2 drops neon pink gel food coloring; flavor with almond extract. Fill with seedless raspberry jam (you'll need about 3/4 cup).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Mint-White Chocolate:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Tint the batter with 2 drops mint green gel food coloring; flavor with mint extract. For the filling, microwave 3 ounces chopped white chocolate, 2 tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon butter in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon mint extract and 1 drop mint green gel food coloring.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Blueberry Cheesecake:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Tint the batter with 3 drops royal blue gel food coloring; flavor with vanilla extract. For the filling, mix 4 ounces softened cream cheese and 3 tablespoons blueberry jam.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Lavender-Honey:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Tint the batter with 2 drops violet gel food coloring; flavor with almond or vanilla extract. For the filling, mix 3/4 cup mascarpone cheese, 2 tablespoons honey and 1 teaspoon ground dried lavender.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pineapple:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Tint the batter with 2 drops lemon yellow gel food coloring; flavor with vanilla extract. For the filling, press 3/4 cup pineapple jam through a sieve, discarding any large pieces.</li>
        </ol>
