    <h3>What to Eat, What to Drink, and What to Leave for Poison</h3>
    <h2>Camille T. Dungy</h2>
      <p><strong>I.</strong><br>
        Only now, in spring, can the place be named:<br>
        tulip poplar, daffodil, crab apple,<br>
        dogwood, budding pink-green, white-green, yellow<br>
        on my knowing.   All winter I was lost.<br>
        Fall, I found myself here, with no texture<br>
        my fingers know.   Then, worse, the white longing<br>
        that downed us deep three months.   No flower heat.<br>
        That was winter.   But now, in spring, the buds<br>
        flock our trees.   Ten million exquisite buds,<br>
        tiny and loud, flaring their petalled wings,<br>
        bellowing from ashen branches vibrant<br>
        keys, the chords of spring’s triumph: fisted heart,<br>
        dogwood; grail, poplar; wine spray, crab apple.<br>
        The song is drink, is color.   Come.   Now.   Taste.<br>

      <strong>II.</strong><br>
        The song is drink, is color.   Come now, taste<br>
        what the world has to offer.   When you eat<br>
        you will know that music comes in guises—<br>
        bold of crepe myrtle, sweet of daffodil—<br>
        beyond sound, guises they never told you<br>
        could be true.   And they aren’t.   Except they are<br>
        so real now, this spring, you know them, taste them.<br>
        Green as kale, the songs of spring, bright as wine,<br>
        the music.   Faces of this season grin<br>
        with clobbering wantonness—see the smiles<br>
        open on each branch?—until you, too, smile.<br>
        Wide carnival of color, carnival<br>
        of scent.   We’re all lurching down streets, drunk now<br>
        from the poplar’s grail.   Wine spray: crab apple.<br>

      <strong>III.</strong><br>
        From the poplar’s grail, wine spray.   Crab apple<br>
        brightens jealously to compete.   But by<br>
        the crab apple’s deep stain, the tulip tree<br>
        learns modesty.   Only blush, poplar learns,<br>
        lightly.   Never burn such a dark-hued fire<br>
        to the core.   Tulip poplar wants herself<br>
        light under leaf, never, like crab apple,<br>
        heavy under tart fruit.   Never laden.<br>
        So the poplar pours just a hint of wine<br>
        in her cup, while the crab apple, wild one,<br>
        acts as if her body were a fountain.<br>
        She would pour wine onto you, just let her.<br>
        Shameless, she plants herself, and delivers,<br>
        down anyone’s street, bright invitations.<br>

      <strong>IV.</strong><br>
        Down anyone’s street-bright invitations.<br>
        Suck ‘em.   Swallow ‘em.   Eat them whole.   That’s right,<br>
        be greedy about it.   The brightness calls<br>
        and you follow because you want to taste,<br>
        because you want to be welcomed inside<br>
        the code of that color: red for thirst; green<br>
        for hunger; pink, a kiss; and white, stain me<br>
        now.   Soil me with touching.   Is that right?<br>
        No?   That’s not, you say, what you meant.   Not what<br>
        you meant at all?   Pardon.   Excuse me, please.<br>
        Your hand was reaching, tugging at this shirt<br>
        of flowers and I thought, I guess I thought<br>
        you were hungry for something beautiful.<br>
        Come now.   The brightness here might fill you up.<br>

      <strong>V.</strong><br>
        Come.   Now the brightness here might fill you up,<br>
        but tomorrow?   Who can know what the next<br>
        day will bring.   It is like that, here, in spring.<br>
        Four days ago, the dogwood was a fist<br>
        in protest.   Now look.   Even she unfurls<br>
        to the pleasure of the season.   Don’t be<br>
        ashamed of yourself.   Don’t be.    This happens<br>
        to us all.   We have thrown back the blanket.<br>
        We’re naked and we’ve grown to love ourselves.<br>
        I tell you, do not be ashamed.   Who is<br>
        more wanton than the dancing crepe myrtle?<br>
        Is she ashamed?   Why, even the dogwood,<br>
        that righteous tree of God’s, is full of lust<br>
        exploding into brightness every spring.<br>

      <strong>VI.</strong><br>
        Exploding into brightness every spring,<br>
        I draw you close.   I wonder, do you know<br>
        how long I’ve wanted to be here?   Each year<br>
        you grasp me, lift me, carry me inside.<br>
        Glee is the body of the daffodil<br>
        reaching tubed fingers through the day, feeling<br>
        her own trumpeted passion choiring air<br>
        with hot, colored song.   This is a texture<br>
        I love.   This is life.   And, too, you love me,<br>
        inhale my whole being every spring.   Gone<br>
        winter, heavy clod whose icy body<br>
        fell into my bed.   I must leave you, but<br>
        I’ll wait through heat, fall, freeze to hear you cry:<br>
        Daffodils are up.   My God, what beauty!<br>

      <strong>VII.</strong><br>
        Daffodils are up, my God!   What beauty<br>
        concerted down on us last night.   And if<br>
        I sleep again, I’ll wake to a louder<br>
        blossoming, the symphony smashing down<br>
        hothouse walls, and into the world: music.<br>
        Something like the birds’ return, each morning’s<br>
        crescendo rising toward its brightest pitch,<br>
        colors unfurling, petals alluring.<br>
        The song, the color, the rising ecstasy<br>
        of spring.   My God.   This beauty.   This, this<br>
        is what I’ve hoped for.   All my life is here<br>
        in the unnamed core—dogwood, daffodil,<br>
        tulip poplar, crab apple, crepe myrtle—<br>
        only now, in spring, can the place be named.<br>
