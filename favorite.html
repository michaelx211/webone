            The fast-growing drink trend, called “boba,” that originated in small tea shops from Taiwan during the 1980s has made its way across the Pacific Ocean to America and is gaining popularity rapidly.</br></p>

            <p>But what exactly is boba? The boba (aka the tiny, chewy black balls at the bottom of the drink) is made from tapioca, which is a gluten-free starch extracted from the root of a cassava plant. The actual drink is made from a tea base mixed with milk and flavoring.</p>

            <p>Not all tea is created equal. Only the strong survive, and the FITTEST rule. It's not just a beverage. It's more than that.  It's about your lifestyle of health and longevity.  Being aware of what you put inside of your body. Our unique beverage collections contain no powders, zero preservatives, and no artificial sugars.

            <p>The first of its kind in our industry; our distinct all natural herbal infused FITT collection not only tastes great, but they're great for you. Choose from one of our remarkable all natural Fitt Blasts that provide razor sharp focus, generate mind blowing energy, induce deep relaxation, or enhance your allure.</p>
            <p>Everything you need. Without the things you don't want. The Fitt Is Strong With This One.</p>

            <p>Being a long time milk tea enthusiast, and health fanatic I was seeking an establishment that offered great tasting healthy milk teas. Needless to say; my endeavors didn't yield any fruitful results. I knew I couldn't be the only one who wanted to sustain a healthy lifestyle while enjoying great tasting beverages. That's when I decided to establish Boba FITT, and create a new customer experience that has never been attempted before</p>
