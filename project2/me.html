  <p>So this website is based off the Cosmicomics "The Light Years" where earth may not be the only planet in existance, as it is being watched by another lifeform, you find out that you are being watched and by who is the big question drawing you in. This theme in my website was to create videos or portals to other dimensions. Like people's thoughts and decisions which can be bias and different, I felt as I showed that in my website on the comments underneath the photos, as you progress I wanted the quotes to get more personal as they come close it relates you your very self, but catering than to one individual person is a tricky task, as there are so many uniqie viewers with differnt thought processes. The begining starts as thoughts and decision, like the early start of a relationship, as it gets deeper into a marriage, the quotes become more intimate as if it knows who you are inside at your very core. The website is not like an Artifical Intelligence when it can think on it's own but rather a short clip like a fortune teller saying a possible story or a possible solution to your current problem.<p>
