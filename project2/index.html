            <p>Gummi Ship goes open world
            Traveling through space to reach new worlds with your customizable Gummi Ship has been a staple of the series since the first game. This will evolve to a whole new level for Kingdom Hearts III. While until now you had fly through a linear stage, in Kingdom Hearts III you will be able to freely fly around in 360 degrees through an open environment. The Gummi Ship gameplay will be divided into battle phases and exploration phases. Evolved gameplay here will surely make customizing your Gummi Ship even more important than before.
