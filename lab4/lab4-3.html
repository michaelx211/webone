            New world themed on Monsters, Inc. Let’s start with the obvious stuff. In the newly revealed trailer, Monsters, Inc. was introduced as the second Pixar world introduced for the game after Toy Story. Sora, Goofy and Donald are clad in monster-like outfits, and they will be teaming up with Sully and Mike to traverse through a world with gimmicks, obstacles and foes that match the setting of the Monsters, Inc. universe.

            <figcaption>Gummi Ship goes open world
            Traveling through space to reach new worlds with your customizable Gummi Ship has been a staple of the series since the first game. This will evolve to a whole new level for Kingdom Hearts III. While until now you had fly through a linear stage, in Kingdom Hearts III you will be able to freely fly around in 360 degrees through an open environment. The Gummi Ship gameplay will be divided into battle phases and exploration phases. Evolved gameplay here will surely make customizing your Gummi Ship even more important than before.
